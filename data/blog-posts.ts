This guide shows how to build a custom preset that works on both **NUX Mighty Plug Pro** and **Mighty Space**. The workflow mirrors how we create patches on NXRig, so you can dial in tones faster and avoid harsh or muddy results.

---

# ✅ Step 1 — Choose a reference tone
Pick a song you know well and decide on the **tone goal** (clean, edge‑of‑breakup, crunch, or high‑gain). Example references:

- Clean: [Pink Floyd — Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Clean)](/preset/pink-floyd/shine-on-you-crazy-diamond-guitar-clean-guitar/)
- Crunch: [Red Hot Chili Peppers — Under The Bridge (Clean)](/preset/red-hot-chili-peppers/under-the-bridge-guitar-clean-guitar/)
- High‑gain: [Metallica — Enter Sandman (Main Riff)](/preset/metallica/enter-sandman-guitar-main-riff/)
- Blues lead: [Gary Moore — Still Got The Blues (Clean)](/preset/gary-moore/still-got-the-blues-guitar-clean-guitar/)

# ✅ Step 2 — Set the amp first
Start with the amp model and keep the chain minimal:

- **Gain**: start low and raise it until chords sustain.
- **Master**: increase for fullness, but avoid clipping.
- **Presence**: use sparingly to avoid fizz.

# ✅ Step 3 — Shape the EQ
Use small moves:

- **Bass**: cut if the tone is boomy.
- **Mid**: boost to sit in a mix.
- **Treble**: add clarity without harshness.

# ✅ Step 4 — Add drive (optional)
Overdrive helps tighten palm mutes and adds clarity. For metal, keep **drive low** and use it as a boost. For blues/lead, push the gain a little more.

# ✅ Step 5 — Time‑based effects
- **Reverb**: small room or plate for natural space.
- **Delay**: short repeats for lead lines, dotted for ambient.
- **Chorus**: great for 80s cleans and funk rhythm.

# ✅ Step 6 — Match output and test pickups
Save to a slot and check:

- Neck pickup for smooth leads.
- Bridge pickup for attack.
- Compare on both devices if you can.

---

## ✅ Pro tip: start from an existing preset
Duplicate a preset that’s already close and tweak:

- [REM — The One I Love (Clean Verse)](/preset/rem/the-one-i-love-guitar-clean-guitar-verse/)
- [Dire Straits — Sultans Of Swing (Clean Tone)](/preset/dire-straits/sultans-of-swing-guitar-guitar-clean-tone/)

      "What Are Impulse Responses (IR) and Tone Matching in Guitar Presets?",
    excerpt:
      "An easy-to-understand explanation of impulse responses, cabinet simulation, and tone matching for NUX Mighty devices.",
    date: "2026-01-18T09:00:00.000Z",
    tags: ["IR", "Tone Matching", "Education"],
    coverImage: "/images/og-image.svg",
    content: `
Impulse Responses (IRs) and tone matching are the two most powerful tools for getting **record‑ready guitar tone** on compact devices like the **NUX Mighty Plug Pro** and **Mighty Space**.

---

# 🎛️ What is an IR (Impulse Response)?
An IR is a **digital snapshot** of a speaker cabinet, microphone, and room.  
It shapes the final guitar tone even more than the amp model itself.

---

# 🎚️ Why IRs matter
Changing only the IR can make a preset:
- **Brighter** or **darker**
- **Tighter** in the low end
- More **roomy** or **focused**

If your tone feels harsh or boxy, try swapping the IR before changing the amp.

---

# 🎯 What is tone matching?
Tone matching compares your current tone to a **reference recording** and applies EQ curves to bring you closer to that sound. It’s especially useful for recreating famous tones.

---

# ✅ How to apply this on NXRig presets
Many NXRig presets already include IR and EQ choices tuned to the original song:

- [Metallica — Enter Sandman (Main Riff)](/preset/metallica/enter-sandman-guitar-main-riff/)
- [Pink Floyd — Comfortably Numb (Solo)](/preset/pink-floyd/comfortably-numb-guitar-solo/)
- [Nirvana — Come As You Are (Intro)](/preset/nirvana/come-as-you-are-guitar-intro/)

If you want to customize:
1. Keep amp settings stable.  
2. Swap IRs first.  
3. Adjust EQ last.

---

## ✅ Quick rule of thumb
If your tone is **thin**, pick a darker IR.  
If it’s **muddy**, pick a brighter one.
