# 🎛️ What is an IR (Impulse Response)?
- An IR is a digital “snapshot” of a speaker cabinet.
- It captures how a cab, mic, and room color the tone.

# 🎚️ Why IRs matter
- They shape the final tone more than the amp model.
- Swapping IRs can make a preset feel darker, brighter, tighter, or wider.

# 🎯 What is tone matching?
- Tone matching compares your tone to a reference track.
- It applies EQ curves to get you closer to the original sound.
